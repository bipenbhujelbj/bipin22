                    <P>This photo is from the day we met during the welcome program, and I will never forget it.
                        I was so happy that day because we spent so much time together, talking, laughing, and
                        even having lunch side by side. Every moment felt so special,
                        like the world had paused just for us. I wish we could have another day just like
                        that — full of joy, laughter, and closeness. That day will always stay in
                        my heart because it was the day of our first kiss, and it became one of the most unforgettable
                        and favorite days of my life. I treasure it deeply, and thinking about it still makes me smile.
                    </P>

                            beside me.
                            I was so nervous that my hands were completely wet, and my mind felt like it had stopped
                            working.
                            When you took my hand in yours, I felt like I had fallen into another world, completely lost
                            in the moment.
                            I had no idea what to do or say — it was such a magical, unforgettable experience.
                            That moment is one of the best memories of my life, and I will never forget how it made me
                            feel </P>

                        <p>After the welcome program, we went to visit Begnas Lake and spent the whole day together.
                            We shared so many things, laughed a lot, and stole many kisses along the way.
                            I also remember that it rained that day, and we enjoyed every drop. I loved that day so much,
                            and I hope another day like it comes soon — full of happiness, fun, and unforgettable moments with you.</p>

                        <P>This photo is very special to me. You don’t know this, but I have it because your mom shared
                            it on her social media story, and I took a screenshot. When I saw this photo,
                            I felt so proud of you. You look like a doctor here, and it made me hope that
                            one day you will become a doctor. You look so good and so happy in this photo.
                            I always wish to see you smiling and happy like this, today and always.</P>
